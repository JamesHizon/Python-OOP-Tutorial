# Python-OOP-Tutorial
Using Corey Schafer's online YouTube tutorial, I quickly learned the fundamentals of 
object-oriented programming.

TOPICS:
1) Classes and Instances
2) Class Variables
3) Class Methods and Static Methods
4) Creating Subclasses
5) Special (Magic/Dunder Methods)
6) Property Decorators - Getters, Setters and Deleters

I will continue to review material prior to working on projects.
This will help me understand software development for data science.
